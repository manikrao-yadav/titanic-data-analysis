# Titanic Simple Data Analysis (EDA) using Python

## Objective
To explore the Titanic dataset and understand factors affecting passenger survival using Python.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Steps Performed
- Data loading and inspection
- Data cleaning (missing values, data types)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Survival analysis based on gender, class, age

## Key Insights
- Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males
- Passengers in 1st class survived more than those in 3rd class
- Younger passengers had better survival chances

## Dataset
Kaggle Titanic Dataset

## Note
This project was created as part of an internship task to demonstrate basic data analysis and EDA skills.
