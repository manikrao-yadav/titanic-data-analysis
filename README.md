# Titanic Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset using Python.  
The work is being done as part of an internship and is **actively evolving**, with new concepts and analyses added daily.

## Objective
To understand the Titanic dataset, clean the data, perform exploratory analysis, and derive insights related to passenger survival using Python-based data analysis techniques.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Work Done So Far
The following tasks have been completed in the current version of this project:

- Loaded and inspected the Titanic dataset
- Worked with Pandas DataFrames for data manipulation
- Data cleaning:
  - Handling missing values
  - Basic data type checks
- Binning:
  - Created bins for numerical features (such as age/fare) to analyze grouped trends
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  - Survival analysis based on gender, passenger class, and age groups
- Data visualization:
  - Bar plots
  - Count plots
  - Distribution plots to identify patterns and trends

## Key Observations (Initial)
- Survival rates differ significantly across passenger classes
- Female passengers had a higher survival rate compared to males
- Certain age groups showed better survival probabilities

## Dataset
- Titanic Dataset (commonly sourced from Kaggle)

## Project Status
🚧 **In Progress**

This notebook will be updated as the internship progresses.  
Upcoming updates may include:
- Additional feature engineering
- More advanced visualizations
- Deeper statistical insights
- Further analysis concepts introduced during the internship
